# Meal Selection System Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and implementation details for a meal suggestion system that provides randomized, weighted meal recommendations while ensuring variety in selections over time.

## System Components

### Initial Interaction

The application begins with a simple user interaction flow:

1. System prompts user for required number of weekly meal suggestions
2. User inputs desired quantity (e.g., 3 meals)
3. System processes request and generates appropriate number of suggestions

### Random Meal Selection Process

The core functionality implements a sophisticated random selection mechanism:

1. System queries the meals database table
2. Applies weighted randomization based on selection history
3. Prioritizes meals that haven't been selected recently
4. Implements exclusion rules for recently selected items

### Selection History Tracking

The system maintains comprehensive selection records:

1. All suggestions are logged in meal_pick_history table
2. Each record includes:
   - Meal identifier
   - Selection timestamp
   - Additional metadata as needed
3. Historical data drives future selection weights

### Intended System Behavior

The system achieves its goals through:

1. Delivering diverse weekly meal suggestions
2. Implementing intelligent deprioritization of recent selections
3. Maintaining controlled randomness in the selection process
4. Ensuring user satisfaction through variety

## Technical Implementation

### Database Architecture

#### Key Tables

1. meals
   - Primary meal information
   - Core attributes and metadata
2. meal_pick_history
   - Historical selection tracking
   - Timestamp-based logging
   - Relationship to meals table

### Selection Algorithm Implementation

The weighted selection mechanism operates on the following principles:

#### Weight Distribution

- Recent selections (within 1 week): Weight = 0
  - Complete exclusion from selection pool
- Moderate history (1-2 weeks): Weight = 1
  - Minimal selection probability
- Older selections (>1 month): Weight = 5
  - Highest selection probability

### Performance Considerations

System performance is optimized through:

1. Database Optimization
   - Strategic indexing on meal_pick_history
     - meal_id index
     - pick_date index
   - Query optimization for large datasets
2. Algorithm Efficiency
   - Optimized weight calculations
   - Efficient random selection process

### Contingency Handling

The system implements robust fallback mechanisms:

1. Primary Scenarios
   - Limited available selections
   - Recent selection constraints
2. Mitigation Strategies
   - Dynamic weight adjustment
   - Flexible selection criteria
   - User notification when needed

### Extensibility Features

The architecture supports future enhancements:

1. Potential Extensions
   - Cuisine-based filtering
   - Dietary preference integration
   - User preference learning
2. Integration Points
   - Modular design for new features
   - Flexible data model
   - Scalable architecture
